# AutoDock Vina pipeline with P2RANK for HTS docking

This repository provides an automated docking solution for ligands and receptor proteins using AutoDock Vina and P2Rank. It supports high-throughput docking workflows and integrates seamlessly with SLURM or can be run locally.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.11**: Core scripting language.
- **AutoDock Vina v1.2.5**: Molecular docking engine.
- **P2Rank v2.4.2**: Binding site prediction.
- **Biopython, RDKit, Open Babel, PyMOL**: Molecular handling, visualization, and preparation tools.
- **SLURM**: Workload manager for distributed computing (optional).

## Requirements
- **Ubuntu 22.04**
- **Miniconda** (Installed via provided scripts)
- **SLURM** (Optional for distributed execution)

### Python Libraries
- `biopython`, `biopandas`, `pubchempy`, `tqdm`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `rdkit`, `pdbfixer`, `pymol-open-source`

### System Tools
- `openbabel`, `wget`, `tar`
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**

## Docking Workflow

The `init_docking.py` script automates the process of docking multiple ligands to multiple receptor proteins. It is designed to handle all necessary steps, from input preparation to generating docking results, with minimal user intervention. Below is a detailed breakdown of its workflow:

---

### **1. Input Parsing**
- The script accepts the following arguments:
  - `--pdb_ids`: A CSV file located in the `./receptors` directory, containing the PDB IDs of receptor proteins. Each ID corresponds to a unique protein structure available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
  - `--ligands`: An SDF file located in the `./ligands` directory, containing one or more ligands for docking.
  - Optional parameters like `--tol`, `--pckt`, `--exhaust`, and `--energy_range` define the docking box dimensions, pocket selection, search thoroughness, and energy range for pose scoring.

---

### **2. Receptor Preparation**
- **Download Receptor Structures**:
  - For each PDB ID listed in the CSV file, the script downloads the corresponding protein structure from the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/).
  - The downloaded file is saved as `<PDB_ID>_dirty.pdb` in a newly created folder named after the receptor (e.g., `./8W88/`).

- **Fixing the Receptor**:
  - Using `PDBFixer`, the script:
    - Retains only the chain with the maximum number of residues.
    - Removes heteroatoms and water molecules.
    - Adds missing residues, atoms, and hydrogens based on a physiological pH of 7.4.
  - The fixed structure is saved as `<PDB_ID>_fixed.pdb`.

- **Receptor Conversion**:
  - The fixed PDB structure is converted to the `.pdbqt` format required by AutoDock Vina. The converted file is saved as `<PDB_ID>.pdbqt`.

---

### **3. Binding Site Prediction**
- The script utilizes [P2Rank](https://github.com/rdk/p2rank) to predict potential binding sites (pockets) on the receptor.
  - The predictions are saved in a folder named `01_p2rank_output` within the receptor's directory.
  - A CSV file (`<PDB_ID>_predictions.csv`) lists each pocket's coordinates, size, and scores.

- The selected pocket (based on the `--pckt` argument) is used to define the docking box dimensions. This includes the center coordinates (`center_x`, `center_y`, `center_z`) and sizes (`size_x`, `size_y`, `size_z`) with an optional tolerance (`--tol`).

---

### **4. Ligand Preparation**
- For each ligand in the provided SDF file:
  - The ligand is converted to `.pdb` format using RDKit.
  - Hydrogen atoms are added, and a 3D conformer is generated for the ligand.
  - The `.pdb` file is converted to `.pdbqt` format required for docking using Open Babel.

- The prepared files are stored in subdirectories within the receptor's folder (e.g., `./8W88/aspirin.pdbqt`).

---

### **5. Docking Execution**
- The script runs AutoDock Vina for each receptor-ligand pair:
  - The docking box is defined using P2Rank predictions.
  - Parameters such as `--exhaust` (exhaustiveness) and `--energy_range` control the thoroughness and energy tolerance for pose scoring.
  - Docking results are saved in `.pdbqt` format, and key details (e.g., binding affinities) are extracted from the output.

---

### **6. Visualization and Results Generation**
- **Visualizations**:
  - PyMOL is used to generate visualizations of the best-docked ligand poses superimposed on the receptor structure. The images are saved as `.png` files.

- **HTML Report**:
  - The script creates an interactive HTML report for each receptor, summarizing:
    - Key docking metrics (binding energies, pocket scores).
    - Links to output files (e.g., `.pdbqt` and `.txt`).
    - 2D and 3D visualizations of ligand-receptor complexes.

---

### **7. Outputs**
- Each receptor has its dedicated directory containing:
  - **Processed Structures**:
    - `<PDB_ID>_dirty.pdb`: Raw receptor structure.
    - `<PDB_ID>_fixed.pdb`: Cleaned receptor structure.
    - `<PDB_ID>.pdbqt`: Receptor ready for docking.
  - **Docking Results**:
    - `<PDB_ID>_results.txt`: Detailed docking logs.
    - `<ligand_name>.pdbqt`: Best poses for each ligand.
    - `<ligand_name>.svg`: 2D ligand structure images.
  - **Visualizations**:
    - `<PDB_ID>_<ligand_name>_docking.png`: 3D visualizations of docked complexes.
  - **P2Rank Predictions**:
    - `01_p2rank_output/<PDB_ID>_predictions.csv`: Binding site information.
