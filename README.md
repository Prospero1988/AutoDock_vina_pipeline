## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 (or other compatible Debian distributions). For advanced users, any Linux distribution can be used, but library and installation package adjustments may be necessary.
  
### Python Libraries

- `biopython`
- `biopandas`
- `pandas`
- `pubchempy`
- `tqdm`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `rdkit`
- `pdbfixer`
- `pymol-open-source`
- `streamlit`
- `bcrypt`

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**

## Installation

The installation process is divided into several main stages. The program is configured to operate under a specific user account and name. If you wish to modify this, locate all instances of `docking_machine` in the `dock_GUI.py` file and replace them with your desired username. The docking server will be set up on this account.

### 1. Create a User Account for Docking

Create a user account named `docking_machine` and assign the necessary administrative permissions to install required packages and libraries. These permissions can be revoked after installation.

```bash
sudo adduser docking_machine
sudo usermod -aG sudo docking_machine
```

Log into the new user account:

```bash
su - docking_machine
```

*Alternatively, relog into this account by opening a new terminal session if you are working via SSH.*

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository and move it to the preferred directory, e.g., `/home/docking_machine/dock`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prospero1988/AutoDock_vina_pipeline.git
mkdir ~/dock
mv ~/AutoDock_vina_pipeline/* ~/dock/
mv ~/AutoDock_vina_pipeline/.* ~/dock/ 2>/dev/null
rmdir ~/AutoDock_vina_pipeline
```

*Alternatively, you can perform these steps manually using your operating system's graphical interface.*

Set access permissions for the `dock` directory:

```bash
chmod -R 755 /home/docking_machine/dock
sudo chown -R docking_machine:docking_machine /home/docking_machine/dock
```

### 3. Install Dependencies and Configure

Navigate to the installation directory and run the installation script. **Do not** start this script with `sudo` to ensure that all packages and libraries are installed under the `docking_machine` user account, not the root account.

```bash
cd /home/docking_machine/dock/installation
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

At this stage, you can already work with the program via the command line by running the `init_docking.py` Python script. However, this method is not very convenient and does not support the workload manager or the graphical interface/server setup.

### 4. Install and Configure SLURM for Task Management

Ensure the system is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install -y munge libmunge-dev libmunge2 build-essential slurm-wlm slurm-client
```

Create an authentication key for Munge:

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/create-munge-key
```

Set appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R munge: /etc/munge /var/lib/munge /var/log/munge
sudo chmod 700 /etc/munge /var/lib/munge /var/log/munge
```

Start and enable the Munge service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable munge
sudo systemctl start munge
```

Verify Munge is working correctly:

```bash
munge -n | unmunge
```

*Expected output: Success (0).*

Add a dedicated user for SLURM:

```bash
sudo useradd -r -m -d /var/lib/slurm -s /bin/false slurm
```

Create necessary directories:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/spool/slurmd /var/log/slurm
```

Set appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R slurm: /var/spool/slurmd /var/log/slurm
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/spool/slurmd /var/log/slurm
```

Check the hostname:

```bash
hostname
```

Edit the SLURM configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/slurm/slurm.conf
```

Add the following minimal configuration, replacing `<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>` with your preferred cluster name and `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with the hostname obtained earlier:

```conf
# Basic Configuration
ClusterName=<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
ControlMachine=<YOUR_HOSTNAME>

# Ports and Authentication
SlurmctldPort=6817
SlurmdPort=6818
AuthType=auth/munge

# Logging
SlurmdLogFile=/var/log/slurm/slurmd.log
SlurmctldLogFile=/var/log/slurm/slurmctld.log

# Resource Management
SlurmUser=slurm
StateSaveLocation=/var/spool/slurmd
SlurmdSpoolDir=/var/spool/slurmd
ProctrackType=proctrack/pgid
TaskPlugin=task/none
SchedulerType=sched/backfill

# Node Configuration
NodeName=localhost CPUs=16 RealMemory=64000 State=UNKNOWN

# Partition Configuration
PartitionName=main Nodes=ALL Default=YES MaxTime=INFINITE State=UP
```

Save the file and set appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo chown slurm: /etc/slurm/slurm.conf
sudo chmod 644 /etc/slurm/slurm.conf
```

Start and enable SLURM services:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable slurmctld
sudo systemctl enable slurmd
sudo systemctl start slurmctld
sudo systemctl start slurmd
```

Check the status of SLURM services:

```bash
sudo systemctl status slurmctld
sudo systemctl status slurmd
```

*Expected output: Active: active (running).*

Ensure all services start automatically on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable munge
sudo systemctl enable slurmctld
sudo systemctl enable slurmd
```

### 5. Configure the Server as a System Service

To ensure the server is always available after a system restart, configure it as a system service using **systemd**.

Create a `streamlit_docking.service` file in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/streamlit_docking.service
```

Add the following configuration, replacing paths as necessary:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Streamlit Docking GUI Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=docking_machine
Group=docking_machine
WorkingDirectory=/home/docking_machine/dock
Environment="PATH=/home/docking_machine/miniconda/envs/auto_dock/bin"
ExecStart=/home/docking_machine/miniconda/envs/auto_dock/bin/streamlit run dock_GUI.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Set the correct permissions and ownership:

```bash
sudo chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/streamlit_docking.service
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/streamlit_docking.service
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable streamlit_docking.service
sudo systemctl start streamlit_docking.service
```

Verify the service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status streamlit_docking.service
```

*Expected output:*
```
‚óè streamlit_docking.service - Streamlit Docking GUI Service
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/streamlit_docking.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since ...
```

Open the necessary ports in the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8001,8501
sudo ufw status
```

Test the setup after a system restart:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, verify the service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status streamlit_docking.service
```

Access the application via a web browser at:

```
http://<YOUR_COMPUTER_IP>:8501
```

### 6. NGINX Reverse Proxy Setup for Streamlit

To access the Streamlit application using the address `http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>` without specifying a port, you need to configure a reverse proxy using a web server like **NGINX**. The reverse proxy will handle requests on the default HTTP port (80) and forward them to Streamlit on port 8501.

#### Instructions for NGINX

##### 1. Install NGINX (if not already installed)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

##### 2. Configure NGINX as a Reverse Proxy

Create a configuration file for your Streamlit application:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/streamlit
```

Insert the following configuration, replacing `<YOUR_LAN_IP>` with your actual LAN IP address:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <YOUR_LAN_IP>;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8501;  # Forward requests to Streamlit
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Handle WebSocket connections (required for Streamlit)
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

##### 3. Enable the Configuration

Create a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/streamlit /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

##### 4. Remove Default Configuration (Optional)

If the default NGINX configuration is not needed, remove it:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

##### 5. Test Configuration and Restart NGINX

Test the NGINX configuration to ensure there are no errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If everything is correct, restart NGINX:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
##### 6. Open Firewall Ports for NGINX

To allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic through the firewall, use the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

Verify the firewall status:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Expected output:

```bash
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
Nginx Full                 ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

##### 7. Test Access

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>
```

#### NGINX as a System Service

NGINX is designed as a system service that automatically starts during system boot. By default, after installation, NGINX is configured to start automatically. However, you can verify or manually enable this option.

##### Check NGINX Status

Run the following command to ensure NGINX is enabled and starts on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl is-enabled nginx
```

The expected output is:

```
enabled
```

##### Enable NGINX at Startup (If Not Enabled)

If the previous command returns `disabled`, you can enable NGINX:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

##### Verify NGINX is Running

Check if NGINX is active:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

If everything is fine, you should see a message similar to:

```
‚óè nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since ...
```

#### Summary

By configuring NGINX as a service and enabling it, it will run automatically at every system boot without needing manual intervention. If your Streamlit server is properly running through NGINX, accessing the application via `http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>` will consistently work after each restart. 

## Running the Application

### Accessing Locally

To access the application on the local computer where the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

*Alternatively, you can use:*

```
http://127.0.0.1:8501
```

### Accessing on LAN

To access the application from other computers within your Local Area Network (LAN):

1. **Ensure NGINX is Properly Configured**: As outlined in the [NGINX Reverse Proxy Setup for Streamlit](#6-nginx-reverse-proxy-setup-for-streamlit) section, NGINX should be set up to forward requests from port 80 to Streamlit's port 8501.

2. **Open Firewall Ports**: Ensure that ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are open in your firewall to allow incoming traffic. This was covered in step 6 of the NGINX setup.

3. **Determine Server's LAN IP Address**: Find the LAN IP address of the server hosting the application by running:

    ```bash
    hostname -I
    ```

    Suppose the LAN IP is `192.168.1.100`.

4. **Access from Other Devices**: On any device within the same LAN, open a web browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://192.168.1.100
    ```

    Replace `192.168.1.100` with your server's actual LAN IP address.

### Executable Python Script

The Streamlit application is defined in `dock_GUI.py`. Ensure that this script is properly installed and configured during the installation process (as described in the Installation section). The Streamlit server is managed as a system service, so it starts automatically on system boot.

You can also manually run the application by navigating to the installation directory and executing:

```bash
streamlit run dock_GUI.py
```

However, it's recommended to use the system service configuration for seamless operation.
